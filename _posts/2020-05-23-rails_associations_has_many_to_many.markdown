This past week I completed my Rails project, the third module project in the Flatiron School.  We were tasked with building a Rails application through complex forms, using RESTful and nested routes. 

While working on this project, I found that taking the time to clearly identify your models and frame how they are associated to one another in the beginning will actually save you time in the long run.  I started with the idea of virtual fitness classes during the coronavirus pandemic and how they are accessible across a wide variety of virtual platforms. From here, I knew that three of my classes would be the instructors, the virtual class and then the participant or user of the class. I saw these three classes interacting like this.
